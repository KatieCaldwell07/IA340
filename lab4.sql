--Q4.1 No, You can not delete VA from the name table because the fips relates to the other tables. 
--Q4.2 No, you can not execute the following SQL code because there is no fips that is 80. That fips number is invalid.
--Q4.3 ChatGPT Prompts: I want to collect census population for each state in different years and their names and fips in a name table. The responses Chat GPT provides are nearly perfect. Depending on the specificty of the prompt ulitmately affects the output of tables that ChatGPT provides.  
--Q4.5 Yes, Chat GPT recognizes the chat perfectly. 
--Q4.6 Code from Chat GPT: SELECT state_name, median_income
FROM income_table
WHERE year = (SELECT MAX(year) FROM income_table)
ORDER BY median_income DESC
LIMIT 1;
--Q4.6 The returned SQL code works. The answer is District of Columbia. Chat GPT provided this SQL code: SELECT state_name, median_income
FROM income_table
WHERE year = (SELECT MAX(year) FROM income_table)
ORDER BY median_income DESC
LIMIT 1;
--Q4.6 The returned SQL code does work. 
--Q4.7 SQL code: import requests
import pandas as pd

# Replace with your Census API key
API_KEY = 'YOUR_CENSUS_API_KEY'

# Virginia FIPS code
VA_FIPS = '51'

# Define the years for which we want to fetch population data (5 years)
years = [2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022]

# Function to fetch population data for Virginia for a specific year
def get_population_data(year):
    url = f'https://api.census.gov/data/{year}/pep/population?get=POP,NAME&for=state:{VA_FIPS}&key={API_KEY}'
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()[1:]  # Skip the header row
        return int(data[0][0])  # Return the population
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to fetch population data for year {year}: {response.status_code}")

# Fetch population data for the past 5 years
population_data = {}
for year in years:
    population_data[year] = get_population_data(year)

# Calculate the growth rate over the 5-year period
population_start = population_data[years[0]]
population_end = population_data[years[-1]]

growth_rate = ((population_end - population_start) / population_start) * 100

# Display the results
print(f"Virginia population in {years[0]}: {population_start}")
print(f"Virginia population in {years[-1]}: {population_end}")
print(f"Population growth rate over the past 5 years: {growth_rate:.2f}%")
--Q4.7 I did not modify the prompt. 
--Q4.8 ChatGPT provides accurate responses for a good majortiy of the requests made for this lab.
